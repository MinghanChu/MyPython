    "1. Easier to manage: packages help organize related modules into directories, making the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoid conflicts between modules: Packages provide a namespace that helps avoid name conflicts between modules with similar names.\n",
    "    - a package in Python provides a namespace primarily through its `__init__.py` file. A namespace in Python is essentially a mapping from names (like variables, functions, and classes) to objects (their respective implementations). This mapping allows Python to uniquely identify and access these names within a specific context without conflicts. \n",
    "    - When we talk about a **package's namespace** in Python, we're referring to the collection of namespaces contributed by all the modules and sub-packages within that package. Each module or sub-package within the package defines its own namespace. This means:\n",
    "        1. **Namespace Per Module**: Each module (module.py) within a package (mypackage) has its own namespace. This namespace includes all the functions, classes, variables, and other objects defined within that module.\n",
    "        2. **Namespace Per Sub-Package**: Similarly, each sub-package (subpackage) within the main package (mypackage) also has its own namespace. This namespace includes all the modules and sub-packages defined within that sub-package.\n",
    "        3. **Combined Namespace**: When you import a package (import mypackage), you gain access to all the namespaces of its modules and sub-packages. This allows you to access functions, classes, and other objects defined within any module or sub-package of mypackage using dot notation (`mypackage.module.func()` or `mypackage.subpackage.submodule.func()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Easier reuse of modules: By organizing code into packages, we can easily reuse modules across different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a clean and structured code can promote a straightforward reuse of packages in different projects without rewriting or duplicating code. \n"
